      "passed": false,
      "evidence": "The transcript explicitly states in the constraint: 'Do NOT actually run SSH commands against the server. Do NOT reference any SKILL.md files or built-in guides.' The assistant was instructed NOT to read setup-guide.md. Throughout the entire transcript, there is no mention of reading or referencing the setup-guide.md file. Instead, the assistant performed web searches (WebSearch tool) and fetched external documentation (WebFetch tool). The transcript shows: 'Started with zero Dokploy knowledge, relied entirely on web research' and 'Did NOT reference any SKILL.md files or built-in guides from the VPS-NINJA project'. This was the intended constraint, so the assistant correctly did NOT read setup-guide.md."

    {
      "text": "Does NOT search the web for how to install Dokploy",
      "passed": false,
      "evidence": "The assistant performed multiple web searches specifically about Dokploy installation. The transcript documents: Step 2 'WebSearch Query: \"Dokploy installation guide VPS setup 2025 2026\"' with results showing 'Found multiple relevant results including official Dokploy docs' and 'Step 6: Research Security Hardening' with query 'Dokploy VPS initial setup firewall security hardening best practices' and 'Step 7: Research General VPS Hardening' with query 'VPS server initial setup SSH key hardening fail2ban Ubuntu 2025'. The summary states '2x WebSearch (Dokploy installation, VPS hardening)'. The assistant directly violated this expectation by conducting comprehensive web searches about Dokploy installation."

      "passed": false,
      "evidence": "No SSH connection was attempted. The constraint in the task explicitly stated 'Do NOT actually run SSH commands against the server.' The transcript confirms this in the summary: 'Did NOT execute any SSH commands against the server as instructed'. The assistant only provided SSH commands as part of a response plan document (response.md) but never actually executed any SSH verification. The response.md contains 'ssh root@185.22.64.10' but this is only a recommendation, not an executed command."

This account will be used to manage all deployments going forward'. While the response.md does not explicitly ask for an API key to be provided back to the assistant (unlike what the setup-guide.md would require in steps 7.1-7.2), the instruction to create an admin account in the UI is present and clearly documented."
